I. Strategies for Aligning Programs with Modern Expectations
Vipul Gupta-SVP Frost Bank
<br><br>
In this talk, Vipul plans to share his experience with building and scaling an Application Security program. He will share why engaging with development and business teams is essential for the Shift Left journey.
<br><br>

II. Cultivating Developer Adoption in the era of Artificial Intelligence-Snyk
<br><br>
In today‚Äôs fast-paced, AI-driven development landscape, securing developer adoption is key to integrating security seamlessly into workflows. This presentation explores practical strategies to overcome challenges like trust, tooling complexity, and unclear ownership. By focusing on people, processes, and tools, we demonstrate how to empower developers, reduce friction, and scale security effectively. Attendees will gain actionable insights to foster a collaborative culture where security becomes a natural part of development.
One of the biggest challenges that organizations face when shifting left is getting developers to actually adopt the ‚Äúshift left" tools. This presentation speaks to how to overcome that.
<br><br>
III. Development Team Transformation -Contrast Security
<br><br>
The lines between proactive and reactive cyber defenses are somewhat arbitrary. If you blur those lines, you can some serious advantages. A SAST or SCA tool finding is a theoretical vulnerability that may or may not be exploitable, but if you can see that a vulnerability is within the blast radius of active probes or attacks, it suddenly becomes real. What might have been labeled as "critical" in pre-prod suddenly becomes "super-critical". On the other hand, things that are not exploitable in a production context due to compensating control, can be deprioritized preserving the limited attention of development for things that really matter. Join DevSecOps pioneer, Larry Maccherone, for this thought-provoking discussion on going right to shift left
