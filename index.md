Container Security Best Practices and Tooling-Optiv
<br><br>

II. Securing APIs in the Cloud: Insights and Best Practices- Palo Alto
<br><br>
This presentation explores the security challenges and opportunities in containerization, emphasizing a defense-in-depth approach. We begin by discussing the widespread adoption of containers and the emerging trends driving innovation, such as serverless computing and hybrid/multi-cloud environments. We then examine key security concerns, including container sprawl, misconfigurations, and supply chain vulnerabilities. A defense-in-depth strategy, starting with shifting security left during development, followed by securing images at rest and implementing runtime protection, ensures comprehensive container security. By integrating cloud workload protection platforms (CWPP) with broader CNAPP strategies, organizations can safeguard containers throughout their entire lifecycle, from code to production
<br><br>
III. From Reactive to Effective: Building Application Security that Works-Mend IO
<br><br>
In 2023, 71% of enterprises admitted their AppSec programs were reactive, playing catch-up with vulnerability alerts -‚Äì while at the same time, applications remain the top target for threat actors. That adds up to increased business risk for a lot of companies and fuels an urgent need to improve application security strategies. But how?
The key is to move from a compliance-based approach to managing application risk.
